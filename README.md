# BOOTSTRAP-IMAGE-GALLERY
This project is developed using front end technologies HTML + CSS + BOOTSTRAP 3. The web application makes use of Bootstrap features such as Jumbotron, Navbar and Grid System. Grid System is the number one reason for this web application to make webside responsive when we hit a breakpoint either small, medium, large or extra large.
